# JavaProjects
A compilation of projects done in Java



## RecipeCalculator
A tool for managing and converting recipes. Just download and run the .jar!


## SmiteBuilder
This is a project done in JavaFX for testing builds/stats for characters in the video game Smite. I quit this project due to the immense amount of information that would need to be entered, along with maintenance for ongoing updates.


## Chess
A basic Chess game done with Java. Does not follow all of the rules (castling, en passant, etc.), but it's playable! Just download and run the .jar
